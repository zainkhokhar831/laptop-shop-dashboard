#### Email Log

With our Email Logging, you can easily store and view a record of all emails sent from your website, providing you with a valuable resource for record-keeping, ensuring email compliance, and debugging during site development.

Our WordPress email logs go beyond just recording emails. With advanced analytics and features, you can measure email engagement and improve email deliverability:

#### Resend Emails

Email Logs make it simple to resend or forward any email directly from the log, which can be incredibly helpful for resending failed emails or forwarding important messages. You can also take advantage of the bulk resend option to quickly resend multiple emails at once.

#### Open and Click Email Tracking

Gain deeper insights into the performance of your WordPress emails by using our email log feature to track opens and clicks. This feature allows you to measure engagement rates and optimize your messaging and calls-to-action for better results.

#### Save Email Attachments

Keep track of all email attachments sent from your WordPress site. This feature allows you to store attachments in one place, making it easy to review and archive them.

#### Export Email Logs

Export your WordPress emails to CSV, EML, or Excel with ease using our intuitive exporter. You can filter the logs by date range, search term, or other criteria to extract only the data you need for your reporting or analysis.

#### Print Emails

Our email logging feature allows you to easily print any email in a clear and easy-to-read format, making it simple to keep track of important email communications. Additionally, you can export email logs to PDF format for convenient digital archiving.

#### Email Alerts

Receive instant notifications if your emails fail to send, with alerts available through Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, SMS/Twilio, webhooks, or email via a secure API.

Combined with our email logging and resending capabilities, Email Alerts guarantee that no critical email will ever be overlooked.

#### Backup Connection

Add a secondary connection that takes over if your main one fails. Easy WP SMTP identifies connection errors and effortlessly shifts to the backup mailer, ensuring that failed emails are automatically retried.

#### Smart Conditional Routing

Set up rules to route different types of emails through various mailers. You can filter by the email's Subject, Message content, From or To addresses, the plugin that generated the email, and more.

This approach lets you combine transactional and marketing providers for enhanced deliverability.

#### Rate Limiting

Control the frequency of emails sent from your WordPress site within a given time to stay aligned with your SMTP provider's limitations.

Easy WP SMTP lets you set limits on how many emails can be sent each minute, hour, day, week, or month and automatically manages the email queue to keep you within the allowed rate.

#### Optimized Email Sending

Is email sending affecting your site's speed? Easy WP SMTP can queue your emails to enhance performance.

With optimized sending, emails are sent in the background when server resources are available, helping to avoid site slowdowns and bottlenecks.

#### Email Reports

Track email deliverability and engagement with our email reports feature, which displays open and click-through rates grouped by subject line, regardless of mailer or SMTP service. The reports also include information on sent and failed emails each week, ensuring that you're always aware of potential issues. Plus, you can view an email report chart right in your WordPress dashboard for quick and easy access.

#### Weekly Email Summary

Stay on top of your WordPress email statistics with our weekly email reports, sent to your inbox. These reports provide in-depth information on the number of emails sent, as well as opens and clicks. The Summary also shows failed email delivery stats, allowing you to quickly identify any potential issues without having to log into WordPress.

#### WordPress Multisite

*WordPress Multisite Network Settings*

Manage WP Mail SMTP settings for all your multisite subsites in one place, simplifying administration for your multisite network.

*Easily Manage Multisite Emails*

Network administrators can easily monitor and manage email logs, email reports, debug events, and exports for all subsites in the network from a central dashboard.

On the Email Test page you can send a test email to your own email address, using your configured mailer or SMTP service, to make sure that your WordPress site is ready to send all outgoing emails.

Once you click the "Send Test Email" button, by default a predefined email template (HTML or plain text) will be sent. But if you prefer, you can also define your own subject and email content in the Email Test settings.

### Other Notes

Inspired by [WP Mail SMTP](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/) plugin

== Installation ==

1. Install Easy WP SMTP either via the WordPress.org plugin repository or by uploading the files to your server. (See instructions on <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/" rel="friend">how to install a WordPress plugin</a>)
2. Activate Easy WP SMTP.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can this plugin be used to send emails via Outlook, Gmail, Google Workspace, Hotmail, Yahoo, Zoho SMTP? =

Yes, it can. You should use the dedicated Gmail or Outlook mailer options, since they are faster and more reliable, compared the the "Other SMTP" mailer.

If you want to use other providers, you'll need to select the "Other SMTP" mailer and configure the correct SMTP host details.

= What to do if you need help or have an issue? =

Please open a new <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/easy-wp-smtp/">support thread</a> and provide as much information as possible, without any private information (it is a public forum).

And we will try to help out as soon as possible.
